# WISe - Wiki Intelligent Search
This script is designed to find required article on wiki and use it to answer users question. It uses wiki api and transformers library.
# Requirements
Before using, you need to install these libraries: requests, transformers and wikipedia-api ( yeah, i know that i can use requests instead of requests, but this is reaaaly early version of script. I will fix this later).
